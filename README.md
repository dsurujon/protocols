IHC
----

Immunohistochemistry protocol optimized to stain rat pancreata with rabbit anti-rat antibodies for insulin and glucagon. A biotinylated secondary antibody is used and the NovaRed HRP system is used for detection. 

16S V4 amplification
----

This protocol outlines the sample processing steps (up to sequencing) for 16S rRNA sequence based bacterial community analysis. The protocol was based on the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/) SOP. Icludes protocol and reagents necessary for sample collection (specifically mouse fecal pellets), DNA extraction, PCR amplification and PCR product quality assesment/putification.
