###Sample Collection


Collect fecal pellets (ideally ~6 pellets/mouse or 250mg) by placing the mouse in a *STERILIZED* 1L beaker.  Use sterilized tweezers to pick up samples. Keep collection tubes on ice, store samples at -20.
Extract DNA using the MOBIO PowerSoil Kit 

###PCR amplification of 16S RNA variable region 4

Do each reaction in triplicate + no DNA control (max 24 samples/plate)

**Work in sterile hood. Make sure all pipet tips, surfaces are sterile.**

For each well: 

|Reagent|Volume|
|-------|------|
|H2O	|11 ul|
|MgCl2 (25uM)	|1 ul|
|5PRIME Master Mix (2.5x)|	10 ul|
|F+R primer mix (10uM each)|	2 ul|
|DNA (50-100ng/ul)	|1ul|
|TOTAL	|25 ul|

###PCR Cycles:
|Repeat|Temp (C)|Time|
|------|--------|----|
|1 |	94|	3 min|
|X35	|94	|45 sec|
|X35	|50	|30sec|
|X35	|72|	1.5min|
|1	|72	|10 min|
|	|4|	HOLD|

Store at 4oC overnight or -20oC long term

Confirm the PCR has worked by running a gel. Combine triplicates, keep negative controls separate. Run 5ul of each (positive and negative separately) with 1.5ul loading dye. Use 100bp ladder. Amplicon should be ~350 bp.

If there is no amplicon, or if the negative control fails, repeat that reaction.


###Amplicon Cleaning

* Shake AMPure beads to resuspend.
* Add 125ul beads to each well, mix
* Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
* Place on magnet stand for >1 minute
* Remove supernatant, wash TWICE with 200ul 70% EtOH
* Remove EtOH, dry for 5 minutes
* Elute in 40 ul TE/elution buffer, mix well
* Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes
* Place on magnet stand for 1 minute, transfer the supernatant to a new plate

Quantify amplicons by nanodropping

Pool samples to get a final concentration of 20nM at a volume >10ul.
