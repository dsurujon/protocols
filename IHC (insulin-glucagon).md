## Immunohistochemistry Protocol for Insulin and Glucagon

#### DAY 1

* Mark slides with the antibody and the animal number (IN PENCIL) 
* De-paraffinize the tissue by incubating in the following media:

|Medium |	Minutes|
|--------|-------|
|Histoclear|	5|
|Histoclear|	5|
|Histoclear|	5|
|100% EtOH|	10|
|100% EtOH|	10|
|95% EtOH|	10|
|95% EtOH|	10|
|Distilled Water|	5|
|Distilled Water|	5|

* Put slides in plastic boat (4 slides/container), add 150 ml Sodium Citrate
* Microwave for 3 minutes
* Let the solution cool for 45 seconds, microwave for another 15 seconds (repeat this 7 times).
* Take the slides out of the microwave, let them cool for 30 minutes on the bench
* Wash slides with the following:

|Medium |	Minutes|
|--------|-------|
|Distilled Water|	5|
|Distilled Water|	5|
|Distilled Water|	5|
|3% H2O2|	10|
|Distilled Water|	5|
|Distilled Water|	5|

* Using the pad pen, draw a rectangle around the tissue(s). This will keep any liquid on the enclosed area. 
* Add 3-4 drops of antibody diluent **(a)** on the tissue, incubate in humid tip boxes for 5 minutes
* Aspirate using the vacuum with a glass Pasteur pipette
* Add 100ul 5% Goat Serum (Dilute in TBST) to each tissue, incubate for 1 hour
* Aspirate
* Add 100ul primary antibody dilution**(b)**, incubate overnight

**(a)** Use Signal Stain Antibody Diluent #8112 for Insulin, TBST for Glucagon

**(b)** 1:400 dilution in SignalStain Diluent 8112 for insulin, 1:100 dilution in TBST for glucagon

---------------------

#### DAY 2
*	Aspirate and add 3-4 drops of TBST on each tissue, incubate for 5 minutes (do this 3 times)
*	Add  200ul secondary antibody**(c)**, incubate 30 minutes
*	Prepare ABC solutionâ€ , incubate it at room temperature for at least 30 minutes
*	Wash with TBST 3 times
*	Aspirate and add ABC solution**(d)**, incubate for 30 minutes
*	Prepare NovaRed**(e)**, keep on ice
*	Wash with TBST 3 times
*	Add NovaRed, incubate 6 minutes
*	Dunk in distilled water
*	Add 2-3 drops of blue hematoxylin, incubate 1 minute 
*	Dunk in distilled water until purple colour is mostly removed
*	Incubate in distilled water for 5 minutes
*	Incubate in FRESH distilled water for 5 minutes
*	Add 3-4 drops of Fluoromount/slide, remove air bubbles with aspirator
*	GENTLY place cover slip on the slide
*	Wait 5 minutes, trace over the edges of the cover slip with nail polish to immobilize the slip
*	Wait 10-15 minutes until nail polish dries

**(c)** 1:100 dilution in TBST of biotinylated anti-rabbit

**(d)** Per tissue: 
*	20ul Solution A 
*	20ul Solution B 
*	960ul TBST

**(e)**
* 5ml Water
* 33ul Reagent 1
* 1 Drop Reagent 2
* 1 Drop Reagent 3
*	1 Drop Hydrogen Peroxide

**TBST** (1 L):
* 100ml 10x TBS
* 1ml Tween
* 900ml water

**Soduim Citrate** (10mM, 1 L):
* 2.94g sodium citrate
* Bring up to 1L with dd-water
* Adjust pH to be 6.00 using sodium hydroxide or citric acid.
